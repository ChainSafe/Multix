# Multix-squid

A [squid](https://subsquid.io) project to support the Multix UI.
It accumulates the chain's accounts, multisigs and proxy relations.

## Prerequisites

- node 16.x
- docker
- docker-compose

## Quickly running the project, without docker (see the project's root readme for docker)

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
npm run install

# 1.1
npm run codegen
npm run typegen

# 2. Compile typescript files
npm run build

# 3. Start target Postgres database from the root of the project
docker compose up -d db

# 4. Apply database migrations from db/migrations
npm run db:migrate

# 5. Now start the squid processor that you wish, see commands.json
npm run start #or specify your own .env based on the .env.example

# 6. The above command will block the terminal
# start the graphql server using the following command in a new terminal
npm run start:graphql-server

# 7. Optionally to see the logs from the db
docker compose logs -f
```

### Involved ports

By default the indexer exposes prometheus metrics at http://localhost:33045
The graphql server and playground is available at http://localhost:4350/graphql

## Docker setup

The database used for the indexer is a Postgres launched in a Docker.
If you have no migration to do, and the project is built already, you can launch the docker with the db and the indexer using:

```bash
docker compose up -d
node -r dotenv/config lib/processor.js
```

This corresponds to `make up` and `make process` from the above steps.

## Dev flow

### 1. Define database schema

Start development by defining the schema of the target database via `schema.graphql`.
Schema definition consists of regular graphql type declarations annotated with custom directives.
Full description of `schema.graphql` dialect is available [here](https://docs.subsquid.io/schema-spec).

### 2. Generate TypeORM classes

Mapping developers use TypeORM [EntityManager](https://typeorm.io/#/working-with-entity-manager)
to interact with target database during data processing. All necessary entity classes are
generated by the squid framework from `schema.graphql`. This is done by running `npx sqd codegen`
command.

### 3. Generate database migration

All database changes are applied through migration files located at `db/migrations`.
`sqd(1)` tool provides several commands to drive the process.
It is all [TypeORM](https://typeorm.io/#/migrations) under the hood.

```bash
# Connect to database, analyze its state and generate migration to match the target schema.
# The target schema is derived from entity classes generated earlier.
npx squid-typeorm-migration generate

# Create template file for custom database changes.
npx squid-typeorm-migration apply
# or make migrate

# Apply database migrations from `db/migrations`.
npx sqd db migrate

# Revert the last performed migration.
npx sqd db revert

# DROP DATABASE.
npx sqd db drop

# CREATE DATABASE.
npx sqd db create
```

### 4. Generate TypeScript definitions for substrate events and calls

This is an optional part, but it is very advisable.

Event and call data comes to mapping handlers as a raw untyped json.
Not only it is unclear what the exact structure of a particular event or call is, but
it can also rather frequently change over time.

Squid framework provides tools for generation of type-safe, spec version aware wrappers around
events and calls.

The end result looks like this:

```typescript
/**
 * Normalized `balances.Transfer` event data
 */
interface TransferEvent {
  from: Uint8Array
  to: Uint8Array
  amount: bigint
}

function getTransferEvent(ctx: EventHandlerContext): TransferEvent {
  // instanciate type-safe facade around event data
  let event = new BalancesTransferEvent(ctx)
  if (event.isV1020) {
    let [from, to, amount, fee] = event.asV1020
    return { from, to, amount }
  } else if (event.isV1050) {
    let [from, to, amount] = event.asV1050
    return { from, to, amount }
  } else {
    // This cast will assert,
    // that the type of a given event matches
    // the type of generated facade.
    return event.asLatest
  }
}
```

Generation of type-safe wrappers for events and calls is currently a two-step process.

First, you need to explore the chain to find blocks which introduce new spec version and
fetch corresponding metadata.

```bash
npx squid-substrate-metadata-explorer \
  --chain wss://rococo-rpc.polkadot.io \
  --archive https://rococo.indexer.gc.subsquid.io/v4/graphql \
  --out rococoVersions.json
```

In the above command `--archive` parameter is optional, but it speeds up the process
significantly. From scratch exploration of rococo network without archive takes 20-30 minutes.

You can pass the result of previous exploration to `--out` parameter. In that case exploration will
start from the last known block and thus will take much less time.

After chain exploration is complete you can use `squid-substrate-typegen(1)` to generate
required wrappers.

```bash
npx squid-substrate-typegen typegen.json
```

Where `typegen.json` config file has the following structure:

```json5
{
  outDir: 'src/types',
  chainVersions: 'rococoVersions.json', // the result of chain exploration
  typesBundle: 'rococo', // see types bundle section below
  events: [
    // list of events to generate
    'balances.Transfer'
  ],
  calls: [
    // list of calls to generate
    'timestamp.set'
  ]
}
```

## Project conventions

Squid tools assume a certain project layout.

- All compiled js files must reside in `lib` and all TypeScript sources in `src`.
  The layout of `lib` must reflect `src`.
- All TypeORM classes must be exported by `src/model/index.ts` (`lib/model` module).
- Database schema must be defined in `schema.graphql`.
- Database migrations must reside in `db/migrations` and must be plain js files.
- `sqd(1)` and `squid-*(1)` executables consult `.env` file for a number of environment variables.

## Types bundle

Substrate chains which have blocks with metadata versions below 14 don't provide enough
information to decode their data. For those chains external
[type definitions](https://polkadot.js.org/docs/api/start/types.extend) are required.

Type definitions (`typesBundle`) can be given to squid tools in two forms:

1. as a name of a known chain (currently only `rococo`)
2. as a json file of a structure described below.

```json5
{
  types: {
    AccountId: '[u8; 32]'
  },
  typesAlias: {
    assets: {
      Balance: 'u64'
    }
  },
  versions: [
    {
      minmax: [0, 1000], // block range with inclusive boundaries
      types: {
        AccountId: '[u8; 16]'
      },
      typesAlias: {
        assets: {
          Balance: 'u32'
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

- `.types` - scale type definitions similar to [polkadot.js types](https://polkadot.js.org/docs/api/start/types.extend#extension)
- `.typesAlias` - similar to [polkadot.js type aliases](https://polkadot.js.org/docs/api/start/types.extend#type-clashes)
- `.versions` - per-block range overrides/patches for above fields.

All fields in types bundle are optional and applied on top of a fixed set of well known
frame types.

## Environment variables

The following environment variables are expected. You can copy `.env.example` into `.env`

```bash
DB_PORT=5432
GQL_PORT=4350
SQD_DEBUG=sqd:processor:mapping

# rococo
BLOCK_START=3510000 # this is the starting block of the indexer
PREFIX=42 # the ss58 prefix for the chain
RPC_WS="wss://rococo-rpc.polkadot.io" # a WS endpoint to connect to a blockchain
ARCHIVE_NAME="rococo" # optional - must be empty or set to the archive name if part of the @subsquid/archive-registry'
CHAIN_ID='rococo' # a unique chain id for the database prefix
IS_ETHEREUM='false'
```

## Differences from polkadot.js

Polkadot.js provides lots of [specialized classes](https://polkadot.js.org/docs/api/start/types.basics) for various types of data.
Even primitives like `u32` are exposed through special classes.
In contrast, squid framework works only with plain js primitives and objects.
This allows to decrease coupling and also simply dictated by the fact, that
there is not enough information in substrate metadata to distinguish between
interesting cases.

Account addresses is one example where such difference shows up.
From substrate metadata (and squid framework) point of view account address is simply a fixed length
sequence of bytes. On other hand, polkadot.js creates special wrapper for account addresses which
aware not only of address value, but also of its
[ss58](https://docs.substrate.io/v3/advanced/ss58/) formatting rules.
Mapping developers should handle such cases themselves.

## Graphql server extensions

It is possible to extend `squid-graphql-server(1)` with custom
[type-graphql](https://typegraphql.com) resolvers and to add request validation.
More details will be added later.

## Disclaimer

This is alpha-quality software. Expect some bugs and incompatible changes in coming weeks.
